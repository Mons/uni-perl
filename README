    utf8, open, mro. Also almost every modern program uses Encode and Carp

        use uni::perl;

        # is the same as

        use strict;
        use feature qw(say state switch);
        no warnings;
        use warnings qw(FATAL closed threads internal debugging pack substr malloc
                unopened portable prototype inplace io pipe unpack regexp
                deprecated exiting glob digit printf utf8 layer
                reserved parenthesis taint closure semicolon);
        no warnings qw(exec newline);
        use utf8;
        use open (:utf8 :std);
        use mro 'c3';
        use Carp qw(carp croak confess);

        # With ':dumper' you got dumper() function, that similar to Data::Dumper::Dumper()
        use uni::perl ':dumper';

        # With ':xd' you got xd() function from Devel::Hexdump (if installed)
        use uni::perl ':xd';
